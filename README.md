   <h1>AWS VPC Setup for Production Environments</h1>
  
  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the AWS VPC Setup project! This repository showcases a comprehensive example of setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) tailored for production environments on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>
  
  <h2>Project Overview:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Multi-AZ Deployment:</h3>
      <p>Our setup deploys servers across two Availability Zones to enhance resilience. Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling groups and an Application Load Balancer, we ensure seamless handling of traffic even during AZ failures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Security Best Practices:</h3>
      <p>Security is at the forefront of our design. We strategically deploy servers in private subnets, safeguarded from direct access. Each public subnet hosts a NAT gateway and a load balancer node, facilitating secure communication between the internet and our servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>NAT Gateway Redundancy:</h3>
      <p>To further fortify resilience, we deploy NAT gateways in both Availability Zones, guaranteeing uninterrupted internet access for our servers.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>How to Use:</h2>
  <p>Feel free to explore our setup, dive into the configuration files, and adapt them to your own AWS environment. Whether you're a seasoned AWS architect or just starting out, this project provides valuable insights into building robust and secure infrastructure on the cloud.</p>
  <p>Let's build resilient and secure environments together! Clone the repository, experiment with the setup, and unleash the power of AWS VPCs. Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or suggestions. Happy coding!</p>
